# SDCSE: Semantic Density Aware Contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings

### A brief description

SDCSE is a framework in the field of Contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings (CSE). It innovatively aligns the l2-norm of sentence embeddings with the semantic density of sentences.

Here, 'semantic density' refers to the amount of information or 'informativeness' contained within a sentence.

The key feature of this alignment is that it allows for the semantic density of a sentence to be gauged directly through the l2-norm of its embedding. 

This approach not only enhances the representational interpretability of sentence embeddings but also simplifies the process of assessing sentence informativeness.
